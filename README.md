# Backtracking

Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

Examples solved using backtracking:

1. Sudoku Solver.
2. Path finding in maze.
